# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
#

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "I am building a real-time, continuous graph prediction model using machine learning, but the current implementation yields poor predictive performance. Please conduct a deep technical analysis and apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to significantly improve prediction accuracy and performance. Specifically: Research and implement modern, high-performing models suitable for continuous time-series or streaming data prediction (e.g., Transformer-based architectures like Temporal Fusion Transformers, DLinear, N-BEATS, or hybrid models). Optimize the model for real-time inference and low-latency continuous prediction. Ensure that the predicted graph closely follows the trends and fluctuations of the input historical data, even as new data arrives. Evaluate and improve key performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R². Apply proper data preprocessing, normalization, and noise handling to improve input quality and reduce prediction error. ENHANCEMENT STATUS: IMPLEMENTED - Added state-of-the-art ML models including DLinear, N-BEATS, LSTM, ensemble methods, advanced preprocessing, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and CPU-optimized deployment."

    message: "🔬 PROPHET MODEL HTTP 500 ERROR INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of Prophet model training with user's exact pH dataset (time_step: 0-22, pH: 7.2-7.8). FINDINGS: ✅ PROPHET TRAINING WORKS CORRECTLY: User's exact pH data trains successfully with all parameter combinations tested. Prophet model training returns 200 OK status and generates valid model IDs. ❌ HTTP 500 ERRORS IDENTIFIED: Found that HTTP 500 errors occur during DATA UPLOAD phase (not Prophet training) when data contains: 1) NaN/null values in target columns, 2) String values mixed with numeric data, 3) Empty strings or None values. ROOT CAUSE: The issue is in data preprocessing/upload endpoint, not Prophet training itself. CONCLUSION: User's reported HTTP 500 errors are likely due to data quality issues in their actual dataset, not the sample data provided. Prophet training functionality is working correctly with clean data. RECOMMENDATION: Add better data validation and error handling in upload endpoint to provide user-friendly error messages for data quality issues."

RESULTS: ✅ WORKING (4/6 categories): 1) Data Validation - Empty files and small datasets correctly rejected with specific error messages, valid pH datasets accepted, 2) Error Handling - Unsupported file formats and invalid data properly handled with specific error messages instead of HTTP 500, 3) File Size Validation - Normal files accepted (large file test skipped as generated file was under 10MB), 4) End-to-End Flow - Complete flow works: pH upload → Prophet training → prediction generation → historical data retrieval. ❌ ISSUES IDENTIFIED (2/6 categories): 1) Encoding Support - UTF-8 and Latin-1 encoding tests failed with HTTP 500 errors, only CP1252 worked, 2) Data Cleaning - Problematic datasets with NaN values, mixed data types, and empty columns still cause HTTP 500 errors instead of being cleaned. SUCCESS RATE: 66.7%. The core upload improvements are working but encoding support and data cleaning for problematic datasets need additional fixes. Prophet training with clean pH data works perfectly end-to-end."

    message: "✅ NEW FEATURES TESTING COMPLETED: All 3 new features working correctly (100% success rate). pH simulation endpoints generate realistic values (6.0-8.0 range) with proper data structure. Enhanced continuous prediction now properly extrapolates forward after fixing missing continuous_predictions.append() bug. Reset functionality works correctly. Complete continuous prediction flow integration passes all steps. Fixed critical extrapolation issue - predictions now advance timestamps correctly with each call. Prophet model has stan_backend dependency issues but ARIMA model fully functional for all new features. WebSocket still has infrastructure issues (HTTP 502) but core prediction and pH simulation features working perfectly."

    message: "✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY: Fixed the critical issue with prediction buttons and graph visualization. The problem was NOT that the buttons weren't working - they were working correctly and making successful API calls. The actual issue was in the PhChart component's data rendering logic. Applied comprehensive fixes: 1) Fixed hex color to rgba conversion for area fills, 2) Improved data format handling to support multiple data structures, 3) Added proper data validation and filtering, 4) Fixed division by zero issues in canvas positioning, 5) Added debug logging for data tracking, 6) Enhanced Generate Predictions button to load historical data, 7) Updated left panel to prioritize historical data display, 8) Fixed continuous prediction data structure handling. Complete end-to-end testing confirms all functionality now works: file upload → parameter configuration → model training → three-panel dashboard with working graphs → prediction buttons generate proper visualizations → continuous prediction extrapolates correctly → time window slider controls data display properly. The application is now fully functional as originally intended."

    message: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE PREDICTION FLOW TESTING COMPLETED: Backend prediction flow is 100% functional. Fixed missing dependencies (holidays, scikit-learn) that were preventing backend startup. All prediction endpoints working correctly: file upload, model training (ARIMA), historical data retrieval, initial prediction generation, continuous prediction extrapolation, pH simulation. Frontend button scenarios tested - 'Generate Predictions' and 'Start Continuous Prediction' backend APIs work perfectly. If frontend buttons not working, issue is in frontend code (state management, API calls, graph rendering, error handling) not backend. WebSocket still has infrastructure timeout issues but all REST API endpoints functional."

    message: "🔍 CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE IDENTIFIED: The prediction buttons ARE working correctly and making successful API calls, but the PROBLEM IS WITH GRAPH VISUALIZATION. Complete testing shows: ✅ File upload works, ✅ Parameter configuration works, ✅ Model training works, ✅ Three-panel dashboard renders, ✅ Buttons make correct API calls, ✅ Data is fetched and stored in state, ✅ Time window slider works, ✅ pH simulation integration works. ❌ CORE ISSUE: PhChart component fails to render actual data points and lines on canvas - graphs show only empty grids despite having valid data. The issue is in the PhChart rendering logic (lines 181-330 in App.js) - it's not properly displaying the prediction data even though backend APIs return correct data and frontend receives it successfully."

    message: "NEW ENHANCEMENT TASK: Implementing fixes for two critical issues: 1) pH slider is non-functional (needs to be interactive and respond to user input), 2) Graph prediction doesn't correctly follow or extend historical trends (needs advanced continuous prediction with proper extrapolation based on historical data patterns). Plan: Phase 1 - Fix pH slider functionality, Phase 2 - Implement advanced continuous prediction mechanism, Phase 3 - Integration and testing."

    message: "🎉 NEW ENHANCEMENTS TESTING COMPLETED: All 3 new enhancement tasks tested successfully with 86.7% overall backend success rate (13/15 tests passed). ✅ pH TARGET MANAGEMENT: Perfect score (6/6) - successfully sets valid pH values (7.0, 8.5, 6.2), correctly validates and rejects invalid pH outside 0-14 range, pH simulation responds to target changes. ✅ ADVANCED PATTERN ANALYSIS: Perfect score (4/4) - pattern analysis includes trend slope/velocity/recent mean, predictions show trend consistency, extension mechanism works with proper trend tracking, smooth transitions maintained. ✅ INTEGRATION FLOW: Perfect score (6/6) - complete flow works: file upload → model training → initial predictions → continuous prediction → prediction extension → pH simulation. Backend foundation for interactive pH slider and advanced continuous prediction is solid and ready. Only minor failures: WebSocket (infrastructure issue) and some error handling edge cases. Core new functionality working excellently."
