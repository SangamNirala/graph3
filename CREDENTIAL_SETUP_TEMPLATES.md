## ðŸš¨ Common Setup Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Authentication failed" errors
**Solution:** Double-check API key format and ensure no extra spaces or characters.

**Solution:** 
- Verify OAuth2 setup is complete
- Check that the service account has edit access to your sheet
- Ensure sheet tab names match exactly: "High Quality Leads", "All Leads", "Outreach Messages"

### Issue 3: OpenAI rate limiting
**Solution:**
- Add usage limits in OpenAI dashboard
- Implement retry logic with delays
- Consider using GPT-3.5-turbo for testing (lower cost)

### Issue 4: Apollo.io quota exceeded
**Solution:**
- Monitor your monthly credit usage
- Reduce batch size in the search parameters
- Upgrade to higher plan if needed

### Issue 5: Slack bot not posting
**Solution:**
- Verify bot has been added to the target channel
- Check bot permissions include `chat:write`
- Test with a simple message first

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Setup

1. **Test with Small Batches First:** Start with 5-10 leads to verify everything works before scaling up.

2. **Monitor API Usage:** Set up monitoring for all APIs to avoid surprise charges.

3. **Backup Configurations:** Export your credential configurations and save them securely.

4. **Version Control:** Keep track of workflow changes and test in a staging environment first.

5. **Error Handling:** Enable error outputs on all nodes to catch and handle failures gracefully.

6. **Logging:** Enable detailed logging in n8n to troubleshoot issues more effectively.
