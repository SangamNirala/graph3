Subject: TechCorp AI's impressive product launch

Hi Sarah,

Congrats on TechCorp AI's recent assistant launch - the technical execution looks impressive! As someone who helps engineering teams scale ML infrastructure, I'd love to connect and share some insights on what we're seeing work well for teams transitioning from prototype to production.

Would you be open to a brief chat about ML scaling strategies?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

#### Email Template (Mike Rodriguez):  
```
Subject: ML deployment strategies for FinTech (DataFlow Series B congrats!)

Hi Mike,

Congratulations on DataFlow's Series B! I saw the announcement and was impressed by your team's focus on ML-driven financial services innovation.

I work with FinTech ML leaders who are tackling similar challenges around model deployment and regulatory compliance. Given DataFlow's growth trajectory, I thought you might find value in a brief conversation about what we're seeing work well for teams scaling ML in highly regulated environments.

Would you have 15 minutes next week for a quick call? Happy to share some specific strategies that have worked for similar stage companies.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. I noticed your recent LinkedIn post about ML hiring - we've helped several FinTech companies build their ML teams efficiently.
